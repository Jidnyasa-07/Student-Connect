As there are 2 switches one can ON the switch from ground floor while entering the staircase and OFF the switch from first floor while exiting the staircase.  This Project makes it easy for users to operate bulbs in staircases.\nConsider the below 2-way switch wiring diagram which has been used to control a bulb in staircase. The schematic shows that circuit is completed and bulb is ON. Suppose you want to OFF the bulb from the upper switch at top of stair  (upper portion of staircase)  simply Switch OFF the switch then circuit will break and the bulb will be OFF. To switch ON the bulb again, just switch ON the same switch at upper portion of staircase. In other words you can OFF and ON bulb from upper switch at the top of stair. Obviously; you can perform the same operation from the bottom switches installed in staircase.\n",

But the major thing is they need not to be activated at a time, Motors need to start after some interval. i.e., sequential control after some delay. So, this sequential control comes in for action. \nWe use an ON delay timer in this sequential control. The timer makes control automatically without any manual help. This saves Manual operation and Timer control is one of the best and easy methods for automatic sequential control.\n",

This switch activates once or twice clapped & deactivates when again clapped once based on the design of the circuit.\n\nThe fundamental concept of the clap switch is that the microphone used in this circuit receives the clap sound & generates a small signal to control a lamp. Generally, this switch is operated through sound. For instance, light, fan, and TV can be controlled through clapping.\nA Clap Switch circuit uses a microphone within the circuit to detect noises to turn the LED on. A clap switch circuit can be used in homes and businesses to turn on things such as lights, TVs, or whatever it is set up to the clap switch. You can often snap your fingers, clap your hands, or even speak to it.",

All the hot objects generate these IR radiations and by detecting these radiations, we can sense the motion. The PIR sensor does not emit any IR radiation but only detects the radiations and thus it is called “passive”. On the other hand, we have IR modules that send an IR pulse continuously and when it bounces back from an object, the module can detect it by using a photodiode. This photodiode in this case can only detect Infrared light and not visible light.\n\nTwo main components of an IR sensor module are IR LED and photodiode. LED looks exactly like a normal LED but it emits IR instead of the visible colors that we are familiar with. Photodiode is the key component that detects the bounced back radiations.\ncomponents required;\n555 timer IC\n220KΩ resistors*2\n100kΩ resistor\n1KΩ resistor\n1uf electrolytic capacitor\nLED\n220Ω resistor\nSPDT Relay*2\nIn4007 diode*2\nBC547 NPN transistor\nBC557 pnp transistor\nDC jack\nIR sensor module",

The winner of the game is decided as per the following conditions:\nRock vs Paper -> Paper wins.\nRock vs Scissor -> Rock wins.\nPaper vs Scissor -> Scissor wins.\nIn this game, the user will be asked to choose according to the choice of user and computer and then the result \nwill be displayed along with the choices of both computer and user.\nSTEPS TO DO THE PROJECT/ METHODOLGY (7/8 LINES) :-\n1. The project starts with the declaration of the variables. \n2. printf() and scanf() functions are used for displaying the content and taking input from the user. \n3. Predefined functions: srand() and rand() is used to generate random numbers in the range [0, \nRAND_MAX) and srand() helps to generate a random number at every interval. \n4. The range is given such as there is an equal probability for the occurrence of the three options; stone, \npaper, and scissors.\n5. game() function: This function consists of if-else statements that will compare the choice between the \nuser and the computer. If the user wins it will return 1. If the computer wins then it will return 0. It will \nreturn -1 if a draw takes place.\nTENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT (2/3 LINES):- \nIn the output screen, the user will be asked to enter their choice amongst rock, paper, and scissors. When the \nuser enters the choice the result will be displayed accordingly\nOften, an opponent who discovers your strategy can easily beat you. The computer on another hand simply \nchooses randomly with an equal probability for each option. Even if you could tell the computer's strategy, there \nis no way for you to use this to beat the computer consistently.\n",

A common application is in lighting, where it allows the control of lamps from multiple locations, for example in a hallway, stairwell, or large room.\nIn contrast to a simple light switch, which is a single pole, single throw (SPST) switch, multiway switching uses switches with one or more additional contacts and two or more wires are run between the switches. When the load is controlled from only two points, single pole, double throw (SPDT) switches are used. Double pole, double throw (DPDT) switches allow control from three or more locations.\nIn alternative designs, low-voltage relay or electronic controls can be used to switch electrical loads, sometimes without the extra power wires.",

  "Description": "IMPORTANCE OF THE DECIDED PROJECT (2/3 LINES):-\nToday in India we are constantly coming to know about terrible road accidents happening across. After \nstudying the data carefully we concluded \nthat most of these accidents are happening due to the misuse of mobile phones by 2-wheeler riders \nduring their rides. Thus to reduce the probability of such mishaps and to avoid neck bending we have \ncome up with two innovations\nTechnical Solution: Smart Jacket.\nNon-Technical: Mobile Holder\nMETHODOLOGY :-\nSMART JACKET\n1. A suitable riding jacket will be selected first.\n2. A wireless BlueTooth communication system will be fabricated.\n3. This system will be implanted in the jacket such that microphones & speakers will be inside \nthe collar.\n4. The battery will be fitted in the region of the lower pocket which will eventually empower the \nentire system.\nMOBILE HOLDER\n1. A mobile holder is made using silicon of the dimensions 5 X 6 X 15 cm.\n2. The mobile holder is to be attached to the shoulder of the jacket. \n3. Fiber rods help to adjust the mobile phone holder onto the jacket.\nTENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT :- \nFrom this project, we hope that citizens will be able to attend to their important calls even while riding \nwithout any neck bending and risk of an accident. This project might provide a more affordable way to \nremain safe",

The ability to compute the attendance percentage becomes a major task as manual computation produces errors, and wastes a lot of time.  For the stated reason, an efficient Web-based application for attendance management system is designed to track student's activity in the class. This application takes attendance feeded by techer and the records of the attendance are storing in a database.The process of recording attendances for students was in the form of hardcopy papers and the system was manually done. Besides wasting time and taking efforts for preparing sheets and documents, other disadvantages may be visible to the traditional one due to loss or damage to the sheets-sheet could be stolen.  So our app will overcome all this issues and add a transperacy to the attendence process.",

  "Description": "When the door of the refrigerator is left open, the temperature inside the cabin will increase. \nThis rise in temperature will be sensed by the thermostat and try to cool down the cabin. It \nwill always try to maintain a constant temperature of the system. The compressor will be \nworking continuously to remove the heat from the cabin, this increases the power \nconsumption from the receptacle. Also, continuous usage under this condition would reduce \nthe life of the compressor and probably malfunction. Hence, integrating an alarm circuit helps \nin saving power and prolong the life of the compressor. We plan to use two IC 555 timers; one connected to the LDR and the other controlling the \nbeeping alarm. When the refrigerator is opened, the in-built light turns on. This in turn \nreduces the resistance of the LDR which we plan to convert into the time for which the \nresistance was low. If we set a predefined time after which alarm should be triggered, this \nsystem would work as intended. With our project, we can prolong the lifespan of the refrigerator compressor and help control \nthe temperature inside the cabin.\n",

These systems are especially useful for plants that have different water needs, such as cacti and succulents that require less water than some other plants. Smart irrigation systems use sensors to monitor soil moisture and weather conditions, and then adjust the amount of water accordingly. This helps to conserve water and prevent over-watering, which can lead to root rot and other diseases. Smart irrigation systems also make it easier to water large areas, as they can be programmed to automatically water multiple sections of a garden or field at once.",

This program’s circuit is based upon cheap NPN transistors. We will  use LDR as a Light sensor and a Relay as a switch.\nThe relay is a digital switch that can handle the maximum current. Here we can also use any type of  Power Mosfets for making the circuit. We are using Relay for making the circuit simple. If the external light falls on LDR then the relay should be turned off. And if the LDR is in Dark then the Relay will be on.it generally the street light circuit project works as here is the simple Schematics of the circuit. The LDR and the 2.2k resistor makes a voltage divider. At first, suppose that the LDR is not capturing the light. Then the Resistance of the LDR will be close to infinite. So, not current will flow from Q1 NPN Transistor. This time current flows from Vcc to Q2 NPN Transistor’s Base through 1k Resistor. It turns on the Q2 Transistor. The Load that is connected with the Q2 Transistor will be turned on. Here we are using light as a light source So, It became turned on. \nIn another way, if the LDR Gets light from outside then the Q1 became conductive and all current flows through the shortest path that is VCC to GND 1k Resistor. No current will flow into the Q2 Transistor’s Base. So, Q2 Transistor will not be triggered as well as the Relay. \n Benefits of street lights:\nThis means controlling the street ligh  depending on the outside lighting conditions. In the case of thick mist, a solar eclipse or dark clouds that bring a storm, by using sensors, the automatic street lighting system enhances public safety by adjusting the light output in the needed area.\n",

But as COVID is not fully eradicated social distancing will still be prevalent in coming time and not only for this but there will be numerous such outspreads of diseases which will call for social distancing. The main issue with social distancing is that the crowd easily forgets about it every now and then. And reminding every person each time is surely not feasible option. \nSo to overcome this social problem, we will develop a SOCIAL DISTANCING ID CARD. This will remind people to maintain social distancing whenever they are too close to some one else. The device will use an ultrasonic sensor, an atmega microcontroller, a buzzer, some basic electronics components and pcb board to develop the system. The device provides an automated social distancing system and be helpful for masses.",

  "Title": "Program to solve Thermodynamics Problems",
  "Description": "A program in the C programming language that solves thermodynamics problems could be used to calculate various thermodynamic properties of a system, such as temperature, pressure, volume, and internal energy. The program would likely use mathematical equations and algorithms to solve for these properties, based on input parameters such as the system's mass, specific heat capacity, and initial temperature. Problems based on First law of thermodynamics and ideal gas equation , Temperature interconversions .The program could also include options for user input, such as the ability to change the system's properties or initial conditions, or to choose between different thermodynamic processes and work done by the gas in all types of processes (Isothermal, isobaric etc). It may also include the ability to solve thermodynamic cycles like Carnot engine etc.",

  "Title": "Speed Control Of Motor Using Potentiometer",
  "Description": "In Industry DC motor is widely used for speed control and load characteristics. It’s easy controllability provides effective and precise output. So, application of DC motor is large for commercial purpose. Speed control of DC motor is very crucial in applications where speed and precision is required and correcting signal and to operate the motor at constant speed. The variable speed drives, till a couple of decades back, had various limitations, such as poor efficiencies, larger space, lower speeds, etc. Control over a wide speed range, both below and above the rated speed can be easily achieved. The methods of speed control are simpler and less expensive than those of alternating current motors., this method of speed control of DC motors can be made to be used in industrial applications and other places where speed control plays an important role. The components needed for this project are Arduino UNO, DC motor, Transistor 2N2222, Potentiometer 100k ohm, Capacitor 0.1uF, Breadboard and Jumping Wires. In this circuit, for controlling the speed of DC motor, we use a 100K ohm potentiometer to change the duty cycle of the PWM (Pulse width modulation) signal. 100K ohm potentiometer is connected to the Arduino UNO and the DC motor is connected to the Arduino. The working of Arduino program is very simple, as it reads the voltage. The voltage is varied by using the potentiometer. After doing some necessary calculation the duty cycle is adjusted according to it. PWM is a technique using which we can control the voltage or power. We can use this model in  conveyor belts ,elevators, cranes, ski lifts, extruders and mixers.",

We will then join the ground of arduino and relay and also join the vcc’s of 5v to each other. Then we will join the both IR sensors. Then we will join the potentiometer which will control the speed of the light to be shifted after each step. Then we will write the code and connect the arduino board to the computer.

  "Description": "Financial benefits: Managing and sending millions of documents such as statements and notifications imply a high cost for financial entities. With appropriate document management software, they will be able to reduce this cost considerably.\nBanks save time: Handling paper documents entails using resources for a great number of manual tasks like putting letters in envelopes before sending them by post. Adequate document management software helps save a huge amount of paper and, therefore, allows removing many manual tasks. This way, the bank will be able to take better advantage of resources and assign them to more important tasks thanks to the substantial amount of time it saves.\nCustomers save time: With agile document management software, banks will be able to provide their customers with all their account information in a fast and efficient manner. Thus, customers will have the possibility of accessing this information through the Internet, which will significantly reduce waiting times and, therefore, increase customer satisfaction. Likewise, customers will be able to electronically sign different types of bank documents, which once again results in time and money savings for customers.\nRegulations: All banks must comply with legal regulations and keep up with the continuous changes that occur in this field. Nevertheless, this may turn out to be hard when most documents are in paper form and compliance with those regulations is monitored manually. Secure document management software meets all these requirements by efficiently protecting customer data.\nOptimized work flow: When documents are managed electronically, it is more agile and efficient to assign each work flow, since employees can easily find the documents and information they need, while complying with working protocols and procedures.\nEnvironmental benefits: Changing to an electronic document management system also involves obvious benefits for the environment. Paper consumption is outstandingly reduced, which implies a decline in tree felling, waste and chemical scrap products.",

But managing the leave applications, leftover paid leaves, and casual leaves is a challenging yet crucial task for the HR team. We all have to write letters/mails and then wait for the response.In case of emergency we even don’t even have time to do all the formalities of requesting for leave. Manually tracking accured leaves is nearly impossible,tedious and time consuming for HR. The importance of this project is to make your work easier and you can effortlessly request for leaves with this app.  The HR/Manager can approve/decline the leave request with this app.\n\nSTEPS TO DO THE PROJECT/ METHODOLGY :-\n\nWe are going to use Microsoft Powerapps for this app. Power Apps provides us the business-app-building experience by enabling users to create feature-rich,custom business apps without writing code.We can create three types of apps:- canvas,model driven and portal. In this project we are going to use canvas type. If needed we can also use Model Driven App. We are going to use various features offered by powerapps such as Components,buttons, galleries,various screens with different funcions,etc. Firstly we will provide two users interface to login using credintials i.e. one for HR and one for Employee.From the homepage,a few options will pop up from where you can enter the start and end date to apply for the paid leaves. Employees can even add a reason for the leaves.In the particular section employees can check the status of their applied leave.Users can check the remaining leaves also.In the approval tab of the leave management platform,the manager can take actions on the received leave applications,including Rejected and Approved ,etc. Both employees and managers can access this tab to check the company holidays by applying the year and month filter.\n\nTENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT :-\n\nThe multi-purpose Leave Management System platform provides role-wise accessibility. It means one application can be switches between HRs, employees, and a company manager.Thus, automation saves HRs from performing repetitive tasks. Besides, it eliminates the hassle and cost of investing in more than one software for different organizational departments.\n",

Generally, if we set the width of ON time to 1ms, the servo arm moves to 0 degree position. If we set the width of ON time to 3ms, the servo arm moves to 180 degree position. The width of OFF time (Low Pulse) is maintained constant at around 18ms.\nIn this circuit, 56K & 10k are used to alternate between two ON pulse widths corresponding to 0 degrees and 180 degrees. So clicking one button moves the servo arm to 0 degrees and the other moves the servo arm to 180 degrees.",

A gas detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to organic life, such as humans or animals.\n\nGas detectors can be used to detect combustible, flammable and toxic gases, and oxygen depletion. This type of device is used widely in industry and can be found in locations, such as on oil rigs, to monitor manufacturing processes and emerging technologies such as photovoltaic. They may be used in firefighting.\n\n",

The Blinking LED circuit uses a 555 timer in astable mode, which generates a continuous output in the form of a square wave at pin 3. This waveform will turn LED ON and OFF. The duration of ON/ OFF depends on the time cycle of the square wave. We can change the speed of blinking by changing the value of capacitance.\n\n\nApplications\nIn turning indicator circuits of all types of vehicles and cycles\nIn Strobe lights / SoS signalling circuits (To signal that someone is in danger or needs help)\nTo control wiper motors and create to and fro motion\nIn Light indicators used in cars (The relay version of the flashing LED circuit is used)\nAs an input for applications that require timing pulses.

Several Android widgets are added which are important for carrying out the necessary actions.\nFinally, we provide our app with the permission to access the local SD card storage in the AndroidManifest.xml file. This code allows the app to read and write the .txt file stored in the SD card storage. \nThe application can currently save the text input from  the user and make a .txt file in SD card which can be accessed by the user. When the text is saved, the ‘LOAD’ button displays it on the screen.",

  "Title": "AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT USING LDR",
  "Description": "Automatic street lights using LDRs can help conserve energy by only turning on when needed and turning off when there is enough ambient light. By reducing energy consumption, automatic street lights using LDRs can help save money on electricity bills. Automatic street lights using LDRs can reduce light pollution by ensuring that the lights are only on when necessary.\n\nSTEPS TO DO THE PROJECT/ METHODOLGY (7/8 LINES): -\n1. Gather materials: LDR sensor, microcontroller (such as Arduino), LED light, and necessary wiring.\n2.Connect the LDR sensor to the microcontroller to measure the level of ambient light.\n3. Write a program for the microcontroller to interpret the LDR sensor data and control the LED light.\n4. Set the threshold for the LDR sensor to determine when the LED light should turn on and off.\n5. Test the circuit and program to ensure proper functionality.\n6. Assemble the circuit into a street light housing and mount it in the desired location.\n7. Connect the circuit to a power source, such as a solar panel or electrical grid.\n8. Test the street light to ensure it turns on and off as desired based on ambient light levels.\nTENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT (2/3LINES):\nLED street light will turn on automatically when the ambient light level detected by the LDR sensor drops below a certain threshold. The LED street light will turn off automatically when the ambient light level detected by the LDR sensor rises above the same threshold. The project will result in energy savings by reducing the need for manual control of the street light and by not having the light on when it is not needed.",

Now if any one one comes in the range of these sensors then an alarm will go on in the house. Now if its not a burgler then it can shut off with the help of a password or a fingerprint password when you are standing outside the house and if you are inside the house then there will be a switch inside the house to shut It off. If we are out off town then through an app also we can shut it off if we want too. If the alarm goes on for a bit long time or if we come to know that it’s a real burgler then it will sent a notification to the near by police station.",

  "Title": "Digital Clock",
  "Description": "The project for our programming class is to create a digital clock using the C programming language. \nThe clock will be a graphical application that runs on a computer or other device with a display. The visual aspect of the clock will be implemented using C graphics libraries.\nThe clock will have a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily read the time and set the clock if necessary. The clock will display the current time in a digital format, including the hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock will also have the ability to switch between a 12-hour and 24-hour display format.\nIn order to accurately display the current time, the clock will use the system time and date functions provided by the C standard library. These functions will be used to retrieve the current time and date from the system clock and then display it on the screen.\nThe clock will be developed using an object-oriented programming approach. The clock will be broken down into several classes, such as Clock, Time, Date, and Alarm, each with its own set of functions and properties. This will make the code more organized and easier to understand and maintain.\nOverall, this project aims to provide a functional and visually appealing digital clock application that utilizes the power of the C programming language and C graphics libraries. The project will provide an opportunity for students to learn about graphics programming, system time and date functions, and object-oriented programming concepts in C.",

This robot consists of a robotic arm and gripper or end effector mounted on a mobile base, which is equipped with wheels for mobility.\nThe robotic arm is composed of multiple segments or joints, which are controlled by motors to provide precise movement and positioning. The gripper or end effector, is the part of the robot that is responsible for picking up and holding objects. It is a simple mechanical gripper which works on 3 BO motors.\nThe mobile base of the robot is equipped with a pair of omnidirectional wheels, which are equipped with DC motors which provide power and control for the wheels' movement. The wheels allow the robot to move in any direction, giving it great maneuverability and flexibility in the workspace.\nPick and place robots with wheels are commonly used in a variety of applications, including manufacturing, packaging, and assembly operations. They can help to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of human error by automating repetitive tasks, such as loading and unloading materials, moving parts from one location to another, and assembling products.\nOverall, pick and place robots with wheels are versatile and flexible machines that can help to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase productivity in a wide range of industrial and manufacturing applications.",

The potentiometer is used to adjust the voltage supplied to the motor, which in turn controls the speed of the motor. The project involves designing and building a circuit that incorporates a potentiometer as a speed control mechanism, and testing the circuit to ensure that it functions properly. The circuit may also include additional components such as a power source, a motor, and a switch to turn the motor on and off. The project may also include a discussion of the theory behind the circuit, and an analysis of the results obtained from testing the circuit.\n \n",

In this circuit, 56k and 10k are used to alternate between two ON pulses widths corresponding to 0 degrees to 180 degrees. So clicking one button moves the servo arm to 0 degree and the other to 180 degrees.\n",

A servo motor is an “actuator” that is used to control the angular position, velocity, and acceleration. Servo motor operates at the “PWM” principles, which implies its angle of rotation is constrained by the span of the pulse applied to its “Control PIN”. Fundamentally servo engine is comprised of a DC motor that is constrained by a variable resistor which is known as a “Potentiometer” and a few gears.\nWe can make a servo motor controller circuit with different strategies but here we are using a simple method for making this basic servo controller circuit in which the primary component is a 555 timer IC. A servo motor is an extremely proficient DC motor that is constrained by electrical signals\n",

  "Description": "The trajectory of a vehicle is comprehensively affected by the interactions between the vehicle, the driving behavior, and the road environment. We are trying to develop an system which will reduce High-risk driving behaviors and accidents on accident-prone roads  by identifying the relationship between the trajectory and road geometry. Previous related studies mostly focused on the trajectory deviation at a few points on the road, which cannot capture the continuous variation of the trajectory in an entire curve and as it gets difficult to detect the oppositely coming vehicle. To solve that problem we are going to set sensors at one end of curvy path when a vehicle comes in the radius of the sensor it will give signals at the other end of the path so if there's an vehicle coming in the opposite direction, its driver will a alert and he/she will drive safely, reducing the risks of accidents.",

  "Title": "Unbiased Electronic Dice with LEDs  ( degi dice)",
  "Description": "SYNOPSIS\nIMPORTANCE OF THE DECIDED PROJECT (2/3 LINES):-\t\t\nPlaying with dice needs us to pick up a dice and make sure that it is unbiased.. The dice becomes biased if the shape is not cut well. Also, the dice can become biased due to deformations. If it is a wooden die, it can deform due to dampness in the atmosphere or due to mechanical stress. To solve all these problems which we have with a conventional dice, we have made a dice circuit which solves all the problems of a conventional dice.\n\n\nSTEPS TO DO THE PROJECT/ METHODOLGY (7/8 LINES):-\n1.\tIn this digital dice circuit we have used 6 LEDs, each LED represent a number (1-6) of Dice. LEDs start flashing as we press the Push button and stops when we release it. \n2.\tAfter release, illuminated LED tells the numbers, you got on Dice. Like if fifth no. LED remains ON after releasing the button, means you got 5 on Dice. \n3.\tWe have connected 6 LEDs to the output Q0 to Q5, and the seventh output Q6 is connected back to the RESET PIN 15. So that after LED 6 it starts from the First LED at Q0.o apply the clock pulse at PIN 14 of 4017 IC, we have used 555 timer IC in Astable mode .\n4.\tIn this digital dice circuit we have kept the oscillation frequency so high that no one can cheat.\n5.\t LED flashing speed is directly proportional to oscillation frequency of 555, as High the frequency, as high the speed of flashing. \n\nTENTATIVE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM THE PROJECT (2/3 LINES):-                     \nThere is no chance to cheat as the circuit operates at such a high speed that the circuit is almost imperceptible to the human eye. There is also little maintenance and there is hardly any impact on aging of the circuit. The frequency may vary a bit with change in power supply voltage, aging of the active and passive components but still the randomness will be preserved without any trouble.\n",

  "Title": "Pick and place bot",
  "Description": "Our pick and place robot equipped with wheels is a custom-built machine designed for our course project in robotics. As the name suggests, it is designed to pick up and move objects from one location to another using a combination of a robotic arm, simple mechanical gripper and a mobile base equipped with wheels for mobility. The robotic arm is the key component of the robot that is responsible for moving objects around the workspace. It is made up of multiple segments or joints that are controlled by 3 BO motors to provide precise movement and positioning. The arm is also equipped with sensors and encoders that allow the robot to determine its position and orientation, as well as to detect any obstacles in its path. This allows the robot to move objects with great precision, even in complex or cluttered workspaces. The gripper or end effector is the component that is responsible for picking up and holding objects. It is a simple mechanical gripper which works on 3 BO motors. It uses a set of jaws or fingers to grip objects and hold them in place. The gripper is designed to be versatile and can handle a wide range of different types of objects, making it suitable for a variety of applications. The mobile base of the robot is equipped with wheels, which allow it to move around the workspace. The wheels are equipped with DC motors which provide power and control for the wheels' movement. The wheels allow the robot to move in any direction, giving it great maneuverability and flexibility in the workspace. One of the notable features of our robot is its simplicity, it does not include any additional features such as vision systems or sensors. Despite this, it is still a highly capable machine that is well-suited for a wide range of industrial and manufacturing applications. It can help to increase efficiency and reduce the risk of human error by automating repetitive tasks such as loading and unloading materials, moving parts from one location to another, and assembling products. Overall, our pick and place robot is a custom-built machine designed specifically for our course project in robotics class. It is a sophisticated machine that requires a lot of planning and attention to details to build. We believe that this robot will be a great learning tool for our class and a valuable addition to any manufacturing or assembly operation.\n",

  "Title": "Hangman Game",
  "Description": "The hangman game is developed using C programming language. This game in c programming is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. It is a common word guessing game in which the player must guess one letter at a time to complete a missing word. This game is played between two persons where the first person will enter any random word depending upon his/her choice and the second player needs to guess it under certain number of chances. First player will provide some hints for the same. This game ends after a certain number of incorrect guesses, and the player loses. If the player correctly recognizes all of the letters in the missing title, the game is also over. In this, different loops are used for the number of attempts which a player gets. Also, the conditional statements are used to check the player’s guess is correct/incorrect. In this, arrays and strings are use for traversing each element of the input word as well as the guessed letters entered by the user. Also, C graphics are used to make it attractive. In this project design is straightforward and clean, making it easy for users to learn, use, and navigate.   ",

In this modern-day, every house, building, office, and industry are using overhead water tanks, that fulfil they are daily using water demands. The overflow is a common problem for all of us that wastage lots of water. In this project, we will make a simple electronic circuit called ‘Water Level Indicator’ using water sensor with three levels that consist of inside a tank with the help of 3 LED and a buzzer to indicate that the tank is full to solve this problem. We know that water conducts electricity, the Water level indicator works upon this fact. The water/liquid level indicator is a system that continuously monitors the water/liquid level in a reservoir, tank, or any other container, and gives us the correct information about the water/liquid level. When the water level increase in the tank, then one by one the 3 Metal Contacts connected to input pins will create contact with the common Contact point through the water. In this way, the input pins of the IC get high input voltage and the respective output pins of the IC become LOW (ground), which turns on the LEDs. The 3 LED’s are used as an indicator that indicates the water level inside the tank. The buzzer is used for alarm, when the tank becomes full it generates a loud sound that tells us to turn off the pump.\n\n",

You just have to complete the circuit and place the wires inside the tank at different positions. When you start the water pump to fill the water tank the circuit will activate automatically. It will check if the level of the water inside the tank is full or not, by means of wires that we place inside the tank. If the water level is low or moderate the pump will continue working and when the water level is full the circuit will cut the supply of the water pump and turn it off. ",
